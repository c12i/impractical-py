## Palingrams
“Radar. Kayak. Rotator. Sexes. What do these words all have in common? They’re palindromes, words that are spelled the same forward and backward. Even better are palingrams, whole phrases that behave the same way. Napoleon is the author of the most famous palingram. When he first saw Elba, the island of his exile, he said, “Able was I ere I saw Elba.”
